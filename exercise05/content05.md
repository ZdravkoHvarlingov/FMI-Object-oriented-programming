### What are we going to talk about today?
1. Another implementation of stack - doubling the size of the array;
2. Trying the copy constructor(and operator=) with or without the reference
3. Linked lists - implementation of the basic functionalities and the BIG FOUR

### Tasks
1. Add additional functionalities of the linked list:
    - getting an element on a certain position;
    - adding an element on a certain position;
    - removing an element from a certain position;
    - checking if an element exists;
    - reversing the list;

2. String class - a class which represents a sequence of characters, having the following functionalities:
    -   Constructor accepting a char array;
    -   operator+= for adding a new character;
    -   operator+= for adding another string to the current one;
    -   Size() method;
    -   Concat() method, which accepts another String a returns a new one(concatenation of the strings);
    -   Substring() method - accepts an index and a length and return a new string with the given length, starting from that index;
    -   Implement the BIG FOUR! (in case you use dynamic memory of course);
