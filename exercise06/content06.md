### What are we going to talk about today?
1. Test solution
2. Linked list - optimizations, new functionalities, and nested node class

### Tasks

1. String class - a class which represents a sequence of characters, having the following functionalities:
    -   Constructor accepting a char array;
    -   operator+= for adding a new character;
    -   operator+= for adding another string to the current one;
    -   Size() method;
    -   Concat() method, which accepts another String a returns a new one(concatenation of the strings);
    -   Substring() method - accepts an index and a length and return a new string with the given length, starting from that index;
    -   Implement the BIG FOUR! (in case you use dynamic memory of course);
