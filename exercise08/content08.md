### What are we going to talk about today?
1. **Test results discussion**
    -   when do we use dynamic memory, do you know the amount of data during compile time?
    -   when do we need copy constructor, destructor, etc...
    -   do as less as possible work?
    -   char arrays and strings, especially char pointers...
    -   debugging

2. **Inheritance**
    -   why is it useful?
    -   what does it express?
    -   real life hierarchies.
    -   how does it work in C++?
    
### Tasks
1. Imagine you are developing a system for a vet:
    -   think about 5,6 different animals and make a hierarchy with them (for example animal -> mammal -> cat -> persian cat, animal -> mammal -> dog, animal -> reptile -> snake, etc...)
    -   think about their different properties, features and behavior
    -   create the appropriate classes only when the new class has specific and new features(methods and properties)

2. Look through the hierarchy of the airport.
