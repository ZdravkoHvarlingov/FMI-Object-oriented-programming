### What are we going to talk about today?
1. Pure virtual methods(abstract methods) and abstract classes.

2. Prototype pattern and factory pattern;

3. Static methods and variables in a class, function;


### Tasks
1. Consider the task from the previous exercise. In the add method(adding an animal), don't just copy the pointer but make a deep copy of the object passed.
    -   implement both factory pattern and prototype pattern;

2. Make a static variable that counts the number of objects created from a specific class(or the number of object currently alive);
