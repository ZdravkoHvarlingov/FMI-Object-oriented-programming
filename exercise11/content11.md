### What are we going to talk about today?
1. Static members(variables and functions);
2. Operations with files;
3. Reading a line from a file;
4. Serialization and overloading operator<< and operator>>

### Tasks
1. Make a static function that returns the number of object created from class Animal;
2. You are given 2 file names, copy the content of the first file into the second file;
3. Let's have a struct representing a Point. Overload operator << and operator >>. How would we store the data in a file? All Dots on the same line? A dot per line? Create a file with that format which has no more then 50 Points. Read all of them within your program and write them into another file. Make it using the overloaded operators << and >>;
4. Let's say we want to be able to serialize the Veterinary from the previous exercise(you can get the source from the previous exercise). Make operator << to that Veterinary, and serialize all the animals. Afterwards make operator >>;
